# Project Summary
The GxP Validation Application is designed to streamline the validation processes required in regulated environments. It allows users to create process maps, draft user requirements, conduct risk analyses, and generate validation protocols and reports. Utilizing Supabase as the backend, the application ensures data integrity and user authentication, making it a robust tool for compliance and validation documentation.

# Project Module Description
The application consists of the following functional modules:
1. **Dashboard**: Main panel displaying statistics and summaries.
2. **Process Mapping**: Interactive canvas for creating flowcharts similar to Visio.
3. **User Requirements**: Complete CRUD functionality for managing user requirements with categorization and prioritization.
4. **Risk Analysis**: Assessment tool featuring a risk matrix evaluating severity, probability, and detectability.
5. **Validation Protocols**: Includes Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) with test cases organized in annexes.
6. **Traceability Matrix**: Links between requirements, protocols, and test cases.
7. **Validation Reports**: Comprehensive report generator with standard sections.
