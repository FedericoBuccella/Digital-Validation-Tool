# Project Summary
The GxP Validation Application is a comprehensive tool designed to optimize validation processes in regulated environments. It enables users to create detailed process maps, draft user requirements, perform risk analyses, and generate validation protocols and reports. By leveraging Supabase as its backend, the application ensures robust data integrity and user authentication, positioning itself as an essential resource for compliance and validation documentation.

# Project Module Description
The application consists of the following functional modules:
1. **Dashboard**: Displays key statistics and summaries.
2. **Process Mapping**: Interactive interface for creating flowcharts.
3. **User Requirements**: CRUD functionality for managing user requirements with categorization and prioritization.
4. **Risk Analysis**: Tool for assessing risks using a matrix evaluating severity, probability, and detectability.
5. **Validation Protocols**: Manages Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) with organized test cases.
6. **Traceability Matrix**: Links requirements, protocols, and test cases.
7. **Validation Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports based on validation activities.
