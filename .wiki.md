# Project Summary
The GxP Validation Application is a powerful tool designed to streamline validation processes in regulated environments, particularly in industries such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. It allows users to create detailed process maps, draft user requirements, conduct risk analyses, and generate validation protocols and reports. By utilizing Supabase as its backend, the application ensures strong data integrity and user authentication, making it an indispensable resource for compliance and validation documentation.

# Project Module Description
The application comprises several functional modules:
1. **Dashboard**: Presents key statistics and summaries.
2. **Process Mapping**: Interactive interface for creating flowcharts.
3. **User Requirements**: Manage user requirements with CRUD functionality, categorization, and prioritization.
4. **Risk Analysis**: Assess risks using a matrix that evaluates severity, probability, and detectability.
5. **Validation Protocols**: Organizes Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) with structured test cases.
6. **Traceability Matrix**: Connects requirements, protocols, and test cases.
7. **Validation Reports**: Generates detailed reports based on validation activities.
